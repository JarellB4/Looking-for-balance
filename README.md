# User story
Given most full-stack students have jobs and a family while they participate in this bootcamp, we saw the need for a more simplified version of the daily check-in to see if we were accomplishing our most fundamental needs as students. There are three catagories within each of the three "buckets" of life to address our time in daily: Personal/Famiy, Work, Class. Users will be able to make their own daily list and change it when necessary. Each day they log into their app, they will recieve and inspirational quote at the top and each time the page is refreshed they will recieve and update Dad Joke of the day. Because after all, laughter is the best medicitine. Happy balancing!
